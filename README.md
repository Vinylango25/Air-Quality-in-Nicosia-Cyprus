> A comprehensive study applying machine learning techniques to calibrate low-cost gas sensors for urban air quality monitoring in Nicosia, Cyprus.

## üìç Introduction

Air pollution poses serious health risks, especially in urban environments. Accurate, high-resolution monitoring is critical for policymaking and public awareness.  
However, **reference-grade air quality analyzers** are expensive and sparse.

**Low-cost electrochemical sensors** offer a promising alternative but require **calibration** to overcome issues like:
- Sensor drift over time
- Cross-sensitivity to interfering gases
- Environmental dependency (temperature, humidity effects)

This project investigates the **machine learning calibration** of low-cost sensors measuring **CO, NO, NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, and NOx** using data from **Strovolou Avenue, Nicosia**, compared against Cyprus Ministry of Environment reference stations.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Evaluate raw sensor performance against regulatory standards.
- Apply and compare machine learning models for sensor calibration.
- Validate post-calibration outputs according to **EU Directive 2008/50/EC** standards.
- Analyze the impact of **temporal aggregation** (1-min vs 1-hour).
- Discuss the **transferability** and **practical deployment** of calibration models.

## 2.1.1 Data Splitting Schemes

![Figure 3: Data Splitting Strategies](fig3.png)

- Calibration was performed every 1, 3, and 6 months using different data splitting strategies.
- For monthly calibration, data was sampled continuously from the start of each month.
- For 3- and 6-month calibration, both continuous and interceptive sampling strategies were explored.
- Results showed minimal difference between different sampling approaches.
- Only the schemes illustrated in Figure 3 were considered for the main analysis.

## 2.1.2 Calibration Results Overview

![Figure 4: Correlation between Calibrated LCSs and Reference Measurements](fig4.png)

- 80% of the data was used for training and 20% for validation with 2-min time resolution.
- CO LCS exhibited good agreement with reference data even without ML calibration.
- NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, and SO‚ÇÇ LCSs initially showed moderate to poor correlation.
- ML calibration significantly improved performance for CO, NO‚ÇÇ, and O‚ÇÉ (r > 0.9).
- SO‚ÇÇ calibration remained poor post-ML calibration due to ambient concentrations being below the sensor detection limit.

## 2.1.3 ML Model Performance Evaluation

![Figure 5: Heatmaps of Calibration Performance (R¬≤ and NRMSE)](fig5.png)

- Random Forest (RF) consistently achieved the highest R¬≤, followed by ANN and XGBoost.
- ML calibrations demonstrated lower NRMSE compared to laboratory calibrations.
- CO showed good natural performance; NO‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÉ performance improved dramatically after cross-sensitivity corrections.
- Including NO‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÉ cross-sensitivities as features significantly enhanced model predictions.
- SO‚ÇÇ remained the most challenging pollutant to calibrate effectively.

## 2.1.4 Target Diagram Analysis

![Figure 6: Target Diagrams for Bias and Variance Assessment](fig6.png)

- RF, ANN, and XGBoost models achieved lower normalized RMSE (nRMSE) compared to LR and SVR.
- LAB calibrations for NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, and SO‚ÇÇ exhibited large positive bias; ML models corrected this bias.
- ML models achieved near-zero bias for CO, NO‚ÇÇ, and O‚ÇÉ.
- LAB calibrated data had higher variance compared to ML calibrated data.
- All ML models' points fell within unit circles, indicating no overfitting.

## 2.1.5 EU Directive Compliance Evaluation

![Figure 7: Target Diagrams for EU DQO Compliance](fig7.png)

- EU DQOs require uncertainty below 25% for CO, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ and 30% for O‚ÇÉ.
- RF, ANN, and XGBoost models met DQOs for CO, NO‚ÇÇ, and O‚ÇÉ, but at concentrations well below the EU limit values.
- LAB calibrations had uncertainties exceeding 75% and were excluded from compliance analysis.
- LR and SVR models failed to meet DQO requirements for NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, and SO‚ÇÇ.
- SO‚ÇÇ calibrations never met DQOs even after ML recalibration due to low ambient concentrations.

## 2.1.6 US EPA Data Quality Objectives (DQO) Compliance Assessment

![Figure 8: Spider Plots for Precision and Bias Error Analysis](fig8.png)

- EPA sets 10%, 25%, 30%, 50% error thresholds for regulatory and non-regulatory uses.
- LAB calibrations generally exhibited higher errors compared to ML calibrations.
- ML calibrations (RF, ANN, XGBoost) reduced precision and bias errors to below 25‚Äì30% for CO, NO‚ÇÇ, and O‚ÇÉ.
- CO LAB calibration alone allowed for hotspot and citizen science applications (30‚Äì50% error).
- SO‚ÇÇ calibrations achieved moderate improvement post-ML (30‚Äì45% error).
- Neither LAB nor ML consistently met the 10% threshold required for regulatory applications.

## 2.1.7 Feature Sensitivity Analysis

![Figure 9: Variable Importance for LCS Calibration](fig9.png)

- Sensitivity analysis used Random Forest models to identify feature importance.
- CO calibration depended mainly on CO concentration; little influence from temperature or RH.
- NO‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÉ calibrations were heavily influenced by temperature, RH, and cross-sensitivities.
- Including cross-sensitive gases improved NO‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÉ calibrations by 6‚Äì9% in R¬≤.
- SO‚ÇÇ model performance was affected equally by target gas, environmental, and temporal factors.

## 2.1.8 Effect of Training Data Fraction and Calibration Frequency

![Figure 11: NRMSE and REUmax as a Function of Training Data Fraction and Calibration Frequency](fig11.png)

- NRMSE and REUmax decreased as the fraction of training data increased.
- Monthly calibration (1-month frequency) achieved better performance than 3- or 6-month calibration.
- RF models performed better with frequent recalibration due to limited extrapolation ability.
- For monthly calibration, 70% of data was needed for CO and NO‚ÇÇ and 50% for O‚ÇÉ to meet EU DQOs.
- Interpretive sampling strategies significantly reduced data requirements (down to 22% for long-term calibration).

# üìã Conclusion

- Random Forest models consistently achieved the best calibration performance for CO, NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, and SO‚ÇÇ sensors.
- CO LCS was minimally influenced by temperature and RH, while NO‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÉ were highly sensitive to environmental variables.
- Increasing temporal resolution to 2-min reduced training data requirements by ~6.3%.
- Monthly calibrations required about 50% of data, while 3- or 6-month calibrations needed around 60%.
- Interpretive sampling reduced data requirements to as low as 22%, cutting collocation costs significantly.
- These findings enable more cost-effective, scalable, and high-quality deployment of low-cost sensor networks.
